# EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CLUB - NIGHT

! BG: city_street_night
! MUSIC: low_bass_thrum
! SFX: car_unlock_chirp

Mark’s car is a sleek, black SUV that looks like it belongs to a high-level executive. He opens the passenger door for you with a smirk that tells you he knows exactly what you’re thinking.

# INT. MARK'S CAR - NIGHT

! BG: car_interior_dark
! SFX: door_heavy_thud

(The interior smells of expensive leather and a faint hint of bourbon. The world outside becomes a muted blur behind the heavy tint of the windows.)

MARK
Comfortable?

? How do you settle into the leather seat?

+ [Modest] Pull your skirt down and cross your legs.
    ~ INHIBITION += 5
    ~ SARAH_CONFIDENCE -= 5
    You try to reclaim a bit of the girl you were four hours ago.
	-> #THE_ESCALATION

+ [Provocative] Lean back and let your knees fall open slightly.
    ~ INHIBITION -= 15
    ~ RISK_LEVEL += 10
    ~ MARK_ENTHRALLMENT += 10
    You want him to see exactly what he’s bought with those drinks.
	-> #THE_ESCALATION_SLOW

+ [Inquisitive] "Are these windows really one-way?"
    ~ RISK_LEVEL += 5
    MARK
    (Leaning closer)
    Limo tint. I can see the world, Sarah. But the world only sees a reflection of itself.
# THE_ESCALATION_SLOW

! SHOW: mark, curios, right

Mark doesn't start the engine. Instead, he shifts in his seat, his presence filling the cramped cabin. His hand finds your thigh, his thumb grazing the hem of your skirt.

MARK
You were so bold on the dance floor. But here, in the dark... you’re trembling. 

# THE_ESCALATION

! SHOW: mark, intense, right

Mark doesn't start the engine. Instead, he shifts in his seat, his presence filling the cramped cabin. His hand finds your thigh, his thumb grazing the hem of your skirt.

? How do you handle his touch?

+ [Leaning In] "I'm not sure this is a good idea, Mark."
    ~ SARAH_CONFIDENCE += 10
    ~ INHIBITION -= 10
    You bridge the gap, placing your hand over his and pressing it firmer against your skin.
	-> #THE_DARING_ACT

+ [Playful Deflection] "It's just the air conditioning."
    ~ MARK_ENTHRALLMENT -= 5
    MARK
    Is that so? Let’s see if we can’t warm you up then.

MARK
You were so bold on the dance floor. But here, in the dark... you’re trembling. 

? How do you handle his touch?

+ [Leaning In] "I'm not trembling from fear, Mark."
    ~ SARAH_CONFIDENCE += 10
    ~ INHIBITION -= 10
    You bridge the gap, placing your hand over his and pressing it firmer against your skin.

    MARK
    Is that so? Let’s see if we can’t warm you up then.

# THE_DARING_ACT

Mark’s hand moves higher. The risk of being in a parked car on a semi-busy street starts to feed into your arousal.

! SFX: fabric_rustle

(IF: OUTFIT_RISK > 15)
    MARK
    This outfit... it was an invitation, wasn't it? You wanted someone to notice. You wanted to be caught.
(ELSE)
    MARK
    You look so innocent, Sarah. But I saw the way you watched the crowd watching you.
(END)

? The streetlights flicker through the windshield as a group of clubgoers walks past the car.

+ [Freeze] Stiffen up and look out the window.
    ~ INHIBITION += 10
    You hold your breath as they pass just inches away. They have no idea you're right there.

+ [Show Off] Arch your back and let out a soft moan, regardless of who is outside.
    ~ INHIBITION -= 25
    ~ RISK_LEVEL += 20
    ~ MARK_ENTHRALLMENT += 20
    The thrill of the "almost-seen" sends a jolt through you that makes your head spin.

# THE_CLIMAX_OF_MOMENT

! MUSIC: tension_pulse_heavy

Mark’s voice is a low growl now. He’s no longer just testing you; he’s taking what you’re offering.

MARK
Do you want me to take you home, Sarah? Or do you want to stay right here and see if anyone notices the car rocking?

? Make your choice for the end of the chapter.

+ [The Risk] "Stay here. I want to feel them walk by while you... "
    ~ STATUS = "The Backseat Exhibitionist"
    ~ SARAH_CONFIDENCE += 20
    ! SFX: seat_recline_click
    Mark climbs into the back with you, and the last of your old self vanishes in the shadows of the SUV.

+ [The Destination] "Take me home. I want you all to myself, without the windows."
    ~ STATUS = "The Private Submissive"
    ~ MARK_ENTHRALLMENT += 15
    ! SFX: engine_start_roar
    The car roars to life, and you settle in for the ride, knowing your life will never be the same.
